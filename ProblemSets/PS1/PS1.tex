\section{Summary}
\subsection{Interests}
My reasons for taking this class are primarily related to the data science aspects. I'm interested in economics from the angle that economic considerations often overlap with those in marketing, and this fact makes the techniques I learn in this class likely to provide a valuable foundation for research work I do throughout my marketing PhD program and beyond. 
\subsection{Project}
My initial thoughts of what I would be interested in doing for a project in this course would center around sentiment analysis of Twitter data. However, I am already familiar with the techniques needed to pull such an analysis, so if I do use that as a basis, I would want to incorporate more (either alternative data or additional analysis) to ensure I stretch my abilities.
\subsection{Goals}
I hope to use this class primarily as a way to see where my strengths and interests within data science lie, and then use that knowledge as a jumping off point for future work.
